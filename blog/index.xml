      <description>After a month I figured out that another post here would be something nice to do, right?
I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk a little about each of my current side projects as of this day, starting with my very first app: Studere, which is almost one year without updates. Yeah.
Studere is a fairly basic app, you can add scores by bimester (something apparently only used here in Brazil), create subjects, its appointments and tests and manage your schedule.</description>

      <description>So I&amp;rsquo;ve finally decided to make a decent page here. I&amp;rsquo;m using Hugo as a &amp;ldquo;backend&amp;rdquo; and color me impressed with how easy it was to make everything work. Cocoa is the name of this beautiful and minimalistic theme and kudos to Nishanth, the guy who made it!
I&amp;rsquo;ll try to make posts really as frequent as I can but this isn&amp;rsquo;t a promise.
Enjoy your stay and see you soon!</description>
