    <p>I&rsquo;m a software engineer who seeks to help people. Pretty normal, isn&rsquo;t it? Maybe the musician part isn&rsquo;t, which is a bonus.</p>

<p>I have a couple projects on the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Gild%C3%A1sio+Filho">Play Store</a> of my own, a few albums published on <a href="https://gildaswise.bandcamp.com">Bandcamp</a> and other streaming services, linked down below.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been working with Flutter for a year as of now, and I&rsquo;ve published several apps with it! Between a <a href="https://gildaswise.com/sosin/">chat app with only one message</a>, a <a href="https://paparecall.app">manager for your car recalls</a>, a <a href="https://tap.style">style-based social network</a> and a <a href="https://what.pet">pet breed detector</a>, being the last two <a href="https://joanai.com">AI-driven</a>, you can already tell that Flutter has been amazing for me and I hope I&rsquo;m able to help you! Just hit me up with at <a href="mailto:gildasiogx@gmail.com">gildasiogx@gmail.com</a>!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also the co-founder of Luki, which was both my final project for my graduation as a software engineer and my first try on the &ldquo;app platform&rdquo; market. Luki is a service for small salons or even individual people where you, as a client, can book your next service, receive notifications about it and leave reviews; and your provider has everything they need on their phone instead of using pen and paper to keep track of everything.</p>

<p>Currently, these are the things I know of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Native Android (2 years with Java, 1 year with Kotlin)</li>
<li>Flutter (1.5 years)</li>
<li>Django (2 years)</li>
<li>django-rest-framework (1 year)</li>
</ul>

<p>And these are the lessons that I gathered by using these frameworks and working on the market with Luki:</p>

<ul>
<li>UX is always left behind when it shouldn&rsquo;t, focus on what&rsquo;s best for your clients and their problems</li>
<li>A good idea doesn&rsquo;t mean anything if you don&rsquo;t go around asking every type of person if they have a problem related to it</li>
<li>Software engineering itself means so much more than charts and following patterns defined years ago, and it always revolves around what&rsquo;s best for you, your team and your project</li>
<li>You should <strong>always</strong> get around the fact that everything is already over if you are trying to solve a problem that only exists in your mind.</li>
</ul>

<p>Enjoy your visit and send a message about anything, if desired!</p>
