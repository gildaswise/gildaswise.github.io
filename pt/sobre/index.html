    <p>I&rsquo;m a software engineer who seeks to help people. Pretty normal, isn&rsquo;t it? Maybe the musician part isn&rsquo;t, which is a bonus.</p>

<p>I have a couple projects on the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Gild%C3%A1sio+Filho">Play Store</a> of my own, a few albums published on <a href="https://gildaswise.bandcamp.com">Bandcamp</a> and other streaming services, linked down below.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/2vzy7fYt8GGrxxWYouSfSG">Spotify</a></li>
<li><a href="https://play.google.com/store/music/artist/Gildaswise?id=Axmb4ldcn2xoyerzhu7mf6jva4e">Google Play</a></li>
<li><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/gildaswise/1377906026">iTunes</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.deezer.com/us/artist/14695245">Deezer</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=ntt_srch_drd_B07CRRTCXZ?ie=UTF8&amp;field-keywords=Gildaswise&amp;index=digital-music&amp;search-type=ss">Amazon Music</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I&rsquo;m currently developing and focusing on <a href="https://gildaswise.com/sosin/">Sosin</a>, which is a messaging app with a bit of a twist on how messages are stored. Refer to the link to more information about it!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also the co-founder of <a href="https://lukinow.com">Luki</a> which was both my final project for my graduation as a software engineer and my first try on the &ldquo;app platform&rdquo; market. Luki is a service for small salons or even individual people where you, as a client, can book your next service, receive notifications about it and leave reviews; and your provider has everything they need on their phone instead of using pen and paper to keep track of everything. It&rsquo;s in development as of now (2018) and we are in Teresina, Piauí, Brazil, for now.</p>

<p>Currently, these are the frameworks I learned:</p>

<ul>
<li>Native Android (3 years)</li>
<li>Flutter (8 months)</li>
<li>Django (2 years)</li>
<li>django-rest-framework (1 year)</li>
</ul>

<p>And these are the lessons that I gathered by using these frameworks and working on the market with Luki:</p>

<ul>
<li>UX is always left behind when it shouldn&rsquo;t, focus on what&rsquo;s best for your clients and their problems</li>
<li>A good idea doesn&rsquo;t mean anything if you don&rsquo;t go around asking every type of person if they have a problem related to it</li>
<li>Software engineering itself means so much more than charts and following patterns defined years ago, and it always revolves around what&rsquo;s best for you, your team and your project</li>
<li>You should <strong>always</strong> get around the fact that everything is already over if you are trying to solve a problem that only exists in your mind.</li>
</ul>
