    <p>So, yeah. Maybe I&rsquo;m not good enough doing these blog posts but I swear I&rsquo;ll try to come here at least once a quarter write something about what I learned.</p>

<p>Almost a year has passed since my last post here and <strong>a lot</strong> happened since then.</p>

<p>First of all, I&rsquo;m done with my graduation except some bureaucracy involving getting my degree itself. Second, I found someone amazing that I can&rsquo;t even describe with words. I even made her an <a href="https://gildaswise.bandcamp.com/album/shades-of-yellow">album</a> (which is also on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/2m5g7cASwedJhGK4AoQiOP">Spotify</a>) with songs I composed thinking of her. I&rsquo;m really glad that she exists and I hope she&rsquo;s smiling while reading this.</p>

<p>On the professional side, I kept developing with Android (and Kotlin) mainly the app for my <a href="https://lukinow.com">main project</a> and tried learning iOS developemnt and React Native for the goal of releasing its iOS app, and somehow it just failed to enter my mind. Then <a href="https://flutter.io">Flutter</a> appeared a few months ago and now I&rsquo;m in paradise.</p>

<p>I just finished rebuilding the entire Android app with Flutter in <em>one month</em> working a few hours a day on it, and now it finally runs on iOS too! There&rsquo;s another one coming soon and I&rsquo;m really glad that a framework this intuitive now exists within us.</p>

<p>For now, my plan is to get this project working here on my homeland, and if it doesn&rsquo;t by the end of the year I&rsquo;ll just get to freelancing.</p>

<p>Thank you for the time reading this and until next time!</p>
