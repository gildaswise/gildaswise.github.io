    <p>This was my first tech related publication on any platform available and I&rsquo;m kinda proud of the response!

<p>It&rsquo;s an interesting experience as while I was writing it, a lot of ideas about optimizing the code came and, well, I ended up doing them as you can see on the repo&rsquo;s commit list.</p>
