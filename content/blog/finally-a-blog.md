So I've finally decided to make a decent page here. I'm using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/overview) as a "backend" and color me impressed with how easy it was to make everything work. [Cocoa](https://themes.gohugo.io/cocoa/) is the name of this beautiful and minimalistic theme and kudos to *Nishanth*, the guy who made it!

I'll try to make posts really as frequent as I can but this isn't a promise.

Enjoy your stay and see you soon!
