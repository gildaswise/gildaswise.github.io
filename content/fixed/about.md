I'm a software developer who seeks to help people. Pretty normal, isn't it? Besides joining "late" to the party and for now (2017) with only two years of experience, I can already see what the future beholds and can't wait to see what really comes next.

I have a couple projects on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Gild%C3%A1sio+Filho) of my own, and another where I was paid to make which I'm not that proud of.

I really like Kotlin and Android development in general, still trying to learn about Reactive programming and Django/Python is entering in my book of skills as you read this, so yeah.

Enjoy your visit and send a message or e-mail about anything, if you want!
