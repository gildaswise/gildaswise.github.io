    <p>By using deck.blue, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should therefore make sure to read them carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t make derivative versions.

<h1 id="your-content">Your Content</h1>
<p>deck.blue is a third-party client for the AT Protocol, a social networking protocol created by Bluesky PBLLC. When using deck.blue, you&rsquo;re also subject to their <a href="https://bsky.social/about/support/tos">Terms of Service</a> and <a href="https://bsky.social/about/support/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>. deck.blue enables you to access Bluesky through their <a href="https://bsky.app">bsky.social</a> service by default, this service can also be changed before logging in.</p>
<p>Upon logging in with an <a href="https://blueskyweb.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/19002493054861-Miscellaneous">App Password</a>, a deck.blue account is created using the <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth">Firebase Authentication</a> service. Your App Password is properly encrypted by it, and deck.blue has no access to it. This account is used to securely access various services used by deck.blue, such as <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore">Cloud Firestore</a> for the database and <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions">Cloud Functions</a> for backend functionality. Cloud Firestore is used to safely store your deck.blue&rsquo;s settings and columns, as well as data related to all accounts used. Tokens required for the scheduling feature are also properly encrypted in the database. <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage">Cloud Storage</a> is also used by the Scheduling feature to temporarily store uploaded media before uploading it to Bluesky&rsquo;s servers; this content is immediately deleted once each scheduled post is sent. deck.blue holds no responsibility on what&rsquo;s being scheduled. Once again, any scheduled content is subject to Bluesky&rsquo;s <a href="https://bsky.social/about/support/tos">Terms of Service</a> as well as the Terms described below.</p>
<h1 id="terms">Terms</h1>
<p>Gildásio Filho is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.</p>
<p>You should be aware that there are certain things that Gildásio Filho will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but Gildásio Filho cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.</p>
<p>If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.</p>
<p>Along the same lines, Gildásio Filho does not take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. any posted content is subject to Bluesky&rsquo;s <a href="https://bsky.social/about/support/tos">Terms of Service</a>.</p>
<p>With respect to Gildásio Filho’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. Gildásio Filho accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.</p>
<p>You are prohibited to use the app and any of its features, including the Scheduling feature, to break the law or cause harms to other. This includes, but is not limited to: (a) distribution of child sexual abuse material; (b) engaging in predatory or inappropriate interactions between minors and adults; (c) engaging in human trafficking or sexual exploitation; (d) promoting hate speech, harassment or abuse towards people or groups based on their race, gender, sexual orientation, ethnicity, religion, or disability and (e) to infringe upon or violate our intellectual property rights or the intellectual property rights of others.</p>
<p>At some point, we may wish to update the app. Gildásio Filho does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the browser that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.</p>
<h1 id="changes-to-this-terms-and-conditions">Changes to This Terms and Conditions</h1>
<p>I may update our Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.</p>
<h2 id="contact-information">Contact Information</h2>
