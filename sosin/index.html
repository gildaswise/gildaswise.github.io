<h1 id="sosin">Sosin</h1>

<p>Sosin is a messaging application focused on a fast and secure interaction between its users.</p>

<p>The main idea revolves around being able to only send and see one message at a time, which means there&rsquo;s no history of your messages beside the most recent update.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re talking with someone, and you already sent &ldquo;Hi!&rdquo;, but just updated your message to &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo;, it means that &ldquo;Hi!&rdquo; will be saved as what we call <strong>last message</strong>, and it can be viewed once you unlock that chat, until its removal.</p>

<p>There are no advertisements inside the app, and our only way of monetization is via what was just described, the ability to unlock a chat. That costs what app stores call a &ldquo;Tier 1&rdquo; (US$ 1 in the US, R$ 3.50 in Brazil, and so on) price tag, per chat, and is a <em>consumable</em> purchase, which means once your unlocked chat is removed, you won&rsquo;t get a credit back or something similar. In the future, a subscription will also be available that unlocks all chats (while the subscription is active), with your account.</p>

<p>As said earlier, no history of your messages is saved as every chat on Sosin is composed of the following elements:</p>

<ul>
<li>A timestamp of when that chat initiated</li>
<li>Our internal ID of the user who initiated that chat (the &ldquo;sender&rdquo;)</li>
<li>Our internal ID of the user who received that chat (the &ldquo;recipient&rdquo;)</li>
<li>The sender&rsquo;s message, with only a timestamp of the last edit</li>
<li>The recipient&rsquo;s message, with only a timestamp of the last edit</li>
<li>The last message, with the timestamp of the last &ldquo;lost&rdquo; message (as described above)</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, there isn&rsquo;t a &ldquo;list of messages&rdquo; as every other messaging app, which is our main differential: all messages are <em>overwrited</em> instead of <em>created</em>. Once you send a message on other messaging apps, there will be a new registry for that, while on Sosin, it&rsquo;s always the same registry, forever changing only its contents and timestamp.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re concerned with security, <strong>Sosin is not yet end-to-end encrypted</strong>, but it&rsquo;s backed by Firebase&rsquo;s Cloud Firestore, which is <a href="https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/server-side-encryption">encrypted</a> using the 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard, and each encryption key is itself encrypted with a regularly rotated set of master keys.</p>

<p>We hope you can enjoy Sosin&rsquo;s safe environment for any conversation you want to have with anyone on our platform.</p>
