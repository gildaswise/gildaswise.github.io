<p>Sosin is a messaging application focused on a fast and secure interaction between its users, currently available for on both <a href="https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.gildaswise.chat">Google Play Store</a> and Apple&rsquo;s <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sosin-fast-messaging/id1431918720">App Store</a>.</p>

<p><center><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sosin-fast-messaging/id1431918720?mt=8" style="border:1px solid white;margin:10px;display:inline-block;background:url(https://linkmaker.itunes.apple.com/assets/shared/badges/en-us/appstore-lrg.svg) no-repeat;width:135px;height:42px;background-size:contain;"></a><a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gildaswise.chat&pcampaignid=MKT-Other-global-all-co-prtnr-py-PartBadge-Mar2515-1'><img style="height:64px;border-top:32px;display:inline-block" alt='Get it on Google Play' src='https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges/images/generic/en_badge_web_generic.png'/></a></center></p>

<p>The main idea revolves around being able to only send and see one message at a time, which means there&rsquo;s no history of your messages beside the most recent update. There are no advertisements inside the app, and the only way we earn something is through the process below.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re talking with someone, and you already sent &ldquo;Hi!&rdquo;, but just updated your message to &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo;, it means that &ldquo;Hi!&rdquo; will be saved as what we call <strong>last message</strong>, and it can be viewed once you unlock that chat. A <strong>permanent chat unlock</strong> only costs a penny, so you can always see the last message of that chat.</p>

<p>Once your unlocked chat is removed, you won&rsquo;t get a credit back or something similar. In the future, a subscription will also be available that unlocks all chats (while the subscription is active), with your account.</p>

<p>As said earlier, no history of your messages is saved as every chat on Sosin is composed of the following elements:</p>

<ul>
<li>A timestamp of when that chat initiated</li>
<li>Our internal ID of the user who initiated that chat (the &ldquo;sender&rdquo;)</li>
<li>Our internal ID of the user who received that chat (the &ldquo;recipient&rdquo;)</li>
<li>The sender&rsquo;s message, with only a timestamp of the last edit</li>
<li>The recipient&rsquo;s message, with only a timestamp of the last edit</li>
<li>The last message, with the timestamp of the last &ldquo;lost&rdquo; message (as described above)</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, there isn&rsquo;t a &ldquo;list of messages&rdquo; as every other messaging app, which is our main distinguishing feature: <strong>all messages are <em>overwritten</em> instead of <em>created</em></strong>. Once you send a message on other messaging apps, there will be a new registry for that, while on Sosin, it&rsquo;s always the same registry, forever changing only its contents and timestamp.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re concerned with security, Sosin is using Firebase&rsquo;s Cloud Firestore, which is <a href="https://cloud.google.com/firestore/docs/server-side-encryption">encrypted</a> using the 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard, and each encryption key is itself encrypted with a regularly rotated set of master keys.</p>

<p>We hope you can enjoy Sosin&rsquo;s safe environment for any conversation you want to have with anyone on our platform. Please be sure to read our <a href="https://gildaswise.com/sosin-privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="https://gildaswise.com/sosin-eula">Terms of Service</a>.</p>
