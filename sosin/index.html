<p>Sosin is a messaging application focused on a fast and secure interaction between its users, currently available for on both <a href="https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.gildaswise.chat">Google Play Store</a> and Apple&rsquo;s <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sosin-fast-messaging/id1431918720">App Store</a>.</p>
<p>The main idea revolves around being able to only send and see one message at a time, which means there&rsquo;s no history of your messages beside the most recent update. There are no advertisements inside the app, and the only way we earn something is through the process below.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re talking with someone, and you already sent &ldquo;Hi!&rdquo;, but just updated your message to &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo;, it means that &ldquo;Hi!&rdquo; will be saved as what we call <strong>last message</strong>, and it can be viewed once you get the premium version. You can either pay monthly, yearly or buy the lifetime license!</p>
<p>As said earlier, no history of your messages is saved as every chat on Sosin is composed of the following elements:</p>
<ul>
<li>A timestamp of when that chat initiated</li>
<li>Our internal ID of the user who initiated that chat (the &ldquo;sender&rdquo;)</li>
<li>Our internal ID of the user who received that chat (the &ldquo;recipient&rdquo;)</li>
<li>The sender&rsquo;s message, with only a timestamp of the last edit</li>
<li>The recipient&rsquo;s message, with only a timestamp of the last edit</li>
<li>The last message, with the timestamp of the last &ldquo;lost&rdquo; message (as described above)</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, there isn&rsquo;t a &ldquo;list of messages&rdquo; as every other messaging app, which is our main distinguishing feature: <strong>all messages are <em>overwritten</em> instead of <em>created</em></strong>.</p>
<p><em>What about end-to-end encryption?</em>, you might ask. We don&rsquo;t have it. This is a decision taken for legal purposes. As Sosin doesn&rsquo;t have a history, your current messages are not encrypted and can be accessed if requested by lawyers for some reason, but again, as it doesn&rsquo;t have a history, we can&rsquo;t do anything if the message they&rsquo;re looking for is already long gone, since we&rsquo;re overwriting data.</p>
<p>We hope you can enjoy Sosin&rsquo;s safe environment for any conversation you want to have with anyone on our platform. Please be sure to read our <a href="https://gildaswise.com/sosin-privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="https://gildaswise.com/sosin-eula/">Terms of Service</a>.</p>
<h2 id="version-100-november2020">Version 1.0.0 (November/2020)</h2>
<p>Sosin has recently been rewritten and updated to version 1.0.0, so what changed?</p>
<ul>
<li>The whole database got a better structure to work with</li>
<li>The monetization has changed to subscription/lifetime purchase</li>
<li>The chat page now is more similar to other chat apps</li>
<li>The Channels feature has been removed, you can only search for users manually now</li>
<li>You don&rsquo;t have to wait for your chat member to be online to send messages, the only requisite now is that they&rsquo;ve answered your previous message. To indicate that, we now have read indicators.</li>
</ul>
