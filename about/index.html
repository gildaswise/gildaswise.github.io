    <p>I&rsquo;m a software engineer who seeks to help people. Pretty normal, isn&rsquo;t it? Maybe the musician part isn&rsquo;t, which is a bonus.</p>
<p>I have a few albums published on <a href="https://gildaswise.bandcamp.com">Bandcamp</a> and other streaming services, linked down below.</p>

</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been working with Flutter since I graduated in march/2018, and I&rsquo;ve published several apps with it: between a <a href="https://gildaswise.com/sosin/">chat app with only one message</a>, a <a href="https://paparecall.app">manager for your car recalls</a> (Brazil-only), a <a href="https://tap.style">style-based social network</a> and a <a href="https://what.pet">pet breed detector</a>, being the last two <a href="https://joanai.com">AI-driven</a>. My most recent project was <a href="https://www.dubliveaudio.com/">a audio-only streaming platform</a>! Just hit me up at <a href="mailto:hey@gildaswise.com">hey@gildaswise.com</a> if you need any help for a project!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also the co-founder of Luki, which was both my final project for my graduation as a software engineer and my first try on the &ldquo;app platform&rdquo; market. Luki is a service for small salons or even individual people where you, as a client, can book your next service, receive notifications about it and leave reviews; and your provider has everything they need on their phone instead of using pen and paper to keep track of everything.</p>
<p>And these are the lessons that I gathered by using these frameworks and working on the market with Luki:</p>
<ul>
<li>UX is always left behind when it shouldn&rsquo;t, focus on what&rsquo;s best for your clients and their problems</li>
<li>A good idea doesn&rsquo;t mean anything if you don&rsquo;t go around asking every type of person if they have a problem related to it</li>
<li>Software engineering itself means so much more than charts and following patterns defined years ago, and it always revolves around what&rsquo;s best for you, your team and your project</li>
<li>You should <strong>always</strong> get around the fact that everything is already over if you are trying to solve a problem that only exists in your mind.</li>
</ul>
