      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a software engineer who seeks to help people. Pretty normal, isn&amp;rsquo;t it? Maybe the musician part isn&amp;rsquo;t, which is a bonus.
I have a couple projects on the Play Store of my own, a few albums published on Bandcamp and other streaming services, linked down below.
 Spotify Google Play iTunes Deezer Amazon Music  I&amp;rsquo;m currently developing and focusing on Sosin, which is a messaging app with a bit of a twist on how messages are stored.</description>

      <description>Sosin is a messaging application focused on a fast and secure interaction between its users, currently available for beta testing on Play Store and Apple&amp;rsquo;s TestFlight.
The main idea revolves around being able to only send and see one message at a time, which means there&amp;rsquo;s no history of your messages beside the most recent update. There are no advertisements inside the app, and the only way we earn something is through the process below.</description>

      <title>Flutter: Adding sign in with Google and phone authentication to your app</title>
      <link>https://gildaswise.com/posts/flutter-phone-auth/</link>

      <description>This was my first tech related publication on any platform available and I&amp;rsquo;m kinda proud of the response! I just published it on dev.to and a few days ago on Medium.
It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting experience as while I was writing it, a lot of ideas about optimizing the code came and, well, I ended up doing them as you can see on the repo&amp;rsquo;s commit list.
I&amp;rsquo;m planning to do more tutorials like this for Flutter-related things as being part of the community like this is amazing.</description>

      <title>I kind of left this blog behind</title>

      <description>So, yeah. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;m not good enough doing these blog posts but I swear I&amp;rsquo;ll try to come here at least once a quarter write something about what I learned.
Almost a year has passed since my last post here and a lot happened since then.
First of all, I&amp;rsquo;m done with my graduation except some bureaucracy involving getting my degree itself. Second, I found someone amazing that I can&amp;rsquo;t even describe with words.</description>

      <title>A little overview about side projects!</title>

      <description>After a month I figured out that another post here would be something nice to do, right?
I&amp;rsquo;m going to talk a little about each of my current side projects as of this day, starting with my very first app: Studere, which is almost one year without updates. Yeah.
Studere is a fairly basic app, you can add scores by bimester (something apparently only used here in Brazil), create subjects, its appointments and tests and manage your schedule.</description>

      <title>Finally a blog!</title>

      <description>So I&amp;rsquo;ve finally decided to make a decent page here. I&amp;rsquo;m using Hugo as a &amp;ldquo;backend&amp;rdquo; and color me impressed with how easy it was to make everything work. Coder is the name of this beautiful and minimalistic theme and kudos to Luiz de Prá, the guy who made it!
I&amp;rsquo;ll try to make posts really as frequent as I can but this isn&amp;rsquo;t a promise.
Enjoy your stay and see you soon!</description>
